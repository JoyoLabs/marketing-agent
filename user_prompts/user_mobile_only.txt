App description (your only knowledge of the app): {app_desc}
Store URLs (context only): iOS {ios_url} | Android {android_url}
Target platform: {platform}.
Generate exactly {n} distinct ideas. Each must target a different audience persona and hook.

Creative policy & quality rules:
- Smartphone visuals only. Show an in-hand phone or a large phone-screen close-up as the primary subject.
- Do NOT show laptops, desktops, monitors, keyboards, mice, or tablets.
- Use minimal on-image text; allowed only if <= 4 words, large and highly legible.
- Favor a single, large focal subject, clean background, and high contrast.
- Avoid platform UI elements, device logos, competitor branding, private data, or policy-sensitive content.
- Portrait orientation 1024x1536. Keep safe margins around any text.

Variation requirements across ideas:
- Vary visual style (photoreal lifestyle, bold graphic poster, 3D render, minimal flat illustration, UI-centric mock).
- Vary palette (dark vs light, warm vs cool), subject (people vs object/UI), and tone (playful vs professional).
- Each idea should test a different single insight (time saved, accuracy, relief, clarity, FOMO, novelty, social proof, urgency).

image_prompt formatting for gpt-image-1 (single paragraph, uppercase labels, exactly this order):
