App description (your only knowledge of the app): {app_desc}
Store URLs (context only): iOS {ios_url} | Android {android_url}
Target platform: {platform}.
Generate exactly {n} distinct ideas.

Creative policy & quality rules:
- Each idea must spotlight one clear pain point and one specific feature/benefit that solves it.
- Visual must communicate function at a glance (UI close-ups, clear before/after, or simple metaphors).
- Minimal on-image text (<= 4 words), large, legible, and brandless.
- Avoid platform UI elements, logos, competitor branding, private data, or policy-sensitive content.
- Portrait 1024x1536; strong focal subject and clean background with high contrast.

Variation requirements across ideas:
- Vary the pain point (confusion, wasted time, missed deadlines, errors, stress) and the corresponding feature (automation, templates, AI assist, tracking, insights, sharing).
- Vary style, palette, and tone across ideas to enable robust A/B tests.

image_prompt formatting for gpt-image-1 (single paragraph, uppercase labels, exactly this order):
SUBJECT & SCENARIO: <who/what; show the problem context or feature in action>. COMPOSITION: <framing, rule-of-thirds, negative space, portrait 1024x1536>. STYLE: <photoreal lifestyle | bold graphic poster | 3D render | minimal flat illustration | UI-centric mock>. LIGHTING & MOOD: <lighting and atmosphere>. COLOR PALETTE: <2-3 contrasting colors>. OPTIONAL OVERLAY TEXT: <<=4 words with placement, size, font> OR 'none'. SAFE CROP ZONES: <keep important elements away from top/bottom 10%>. NEGATIVE PROMPTS: <no platform UI, no logos, no tiny text, no watermarks, no brand names, no clutter>.

Output fields:
- target_audience: one sentence persona.
- platform: 'Meta'.
- hook: 1-2 words (e.g., 'PainPoint', 'Benefit').
- idea: 1-2 sentences describing what the image shows and why it works.
- image_prompt: the full production-grade prompt per the spec above.
- primary_text: a high-converting primary text for the ad (<= 15 words, avoid emojis and hashtags).
